 * 
 * An unbounded concurrent {@linkplain Deque deque} based on linked nodes.
 * Concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely
 * across multiple threads.
 * A {@code ConcurrentLinkedDeque} is an appropriate choice when
 * many threads will share access to a common collection.
 * Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class
 * does not permit the use of {@code null} elements.
 *
 * <p>Iterators are <i>weakly consistent</i>, returning elements
 * reflecting the state of the deque at some point at or since the
 * creation of the iterator.  They do <em>not</em> throw {@link
 * java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
 * ConcurrentModificationException}, and may proceed concurrently with
 * other operations.
 *
 * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, the {@code size} method
 * is <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
 * asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current number
 * of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report
 * inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal.
 * Additionally, the bulk operations {@code addAll},
 * {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll}, {@code containsAll},
 * {@code equals}, and {@code toArray} are <em>not</em> guaranteed
 * to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating
 * concurrently with an {@code addAll} operation might view only some
 * of the added elements.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the <em>optional</em>
 * methods of the {@link Deque} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections,
 * actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 * {@code ConcurrentLinkedDeque}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 * the {@code ConcurrentLinkedDeque} in another thread.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

public class ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E>
    extends AbstractCollection<E>
    implements Deque<E>, java.io.Serializable {

    /*
     * This is an implementation of a concurrent lock-free deque
     * supporting interior removes but not interior insertions, as
     * required to support the entire Deque interface.
     *
     * We extend the techniques developed for ConcurrentLinkedQueue and
     * LinkedTransferQueue (see the internal docs for those classes).
     * Understanding the ConcurrentLinkedQueue implementation is a
     * prerequisite for understanding the implementation of this class.
     *
     * The data structure is a symmetrical doubly-linked "GC-robust"
     * linked list of nodes.  We minimize the number of volatile writes
     * using two techniques: advancing multiple hops with a single CAS
     * and mixing volatile and non-volatile writes of the same memory
     * locations.
     *
     * A node contains the expected E ("item") and links to predecessor
     * ("prev") and successor ("next") nodes:
     *
     * class Node<E> { volatile Node<E> prev, next; volatile E item; }
     *
     * A node p is considered "live" if it contains a non-null item
     * (p.item != null).  When an item is CASed to null, the item is
     * atomically logically deleted from the collection.
     *
     * At any time, there is precisely one "first" node with a null
     * prev reference that terminates any chain of prev references
     * starting at a live node.  Similarly there is precisely one
     * "last" node terminating any chain of next references starting at
     * a live node.  The "first" and "last" nodes may or may not be live.
     * The "first" and "last" nodes are always mutually reachable.
     *
     * A new element is added atomically by CASing the null prev or
     * next reference in the first or last node to a fresh node
     * containing the element.  The element's node atomically becomes
     * "live" at that point.
     *
     * A node is considered "active" if it is a live node, or the
     * first or last node.  Active nodes cannot be unlinked.
     *
     * A "self-link" is a next or prev reference that is the same node:
     *   p.prev == p  or  p.next == p
     * Self-links are used in the node unlinking process.  Active nodes
     * never have self-links.
     *
     * A node p is active if and only if:
     *
     * p.item != null ||
     * (p.prev == null && p.next != p) ||
     * (p.next == null && p.prev != p)
     *
     * The deque object has two node references, "head" and "tail".
     * The head and tail are only approximations to the first and last
     * nodes of the deque.  The first node can always be found by
     * following prev pointers from head; likewise for tail.  However,
     * it is permissible for head and tail to be referring to deleted
     * nodes that have been unlinked and so may not be reachable from
     * any live node.
     *
     * There are 3 stages of node deletion;
     * "logical deletion", "unlinking", and "gc-unlinking".
     *
     * 1. "logical deletion" by CASing item to null atomically removes
     * the element from the collection, and makes the containing node
     * eligible for unlinking.
     *
     * 2. "unlinking" makes a deleted node unreachable from active
     * nodes, and thus eventually reclaimable by GC.  Unlinked nodes
     * may remain reachable indefinitely from an iterator.
     *
     * Physical node unlinking is merely an optimization (albeit a
     * critical one), and so can be performed at our convenience.  At
     * any time, the set of live nodes maintained by prev and next
     * links are identical, that is, the live nodes found via next
     * links from the first node is equal to the elements found via
     * prev links from the last node.  However, this is not true for
     * nodes that have already been logically deleted - such nodes may
     * be reachable in one direction only.
     *
     * 3. "gc-unlinking" takes unlinking further by making active
     * nodes unreachable from deleted nodes, making it easier for the
     * GC to reclaim future deleted nodes.  This step makes the data
     * structure "gc-robust", as first described in detail by Boehm
     * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=503272.503282).
     *
     * GC-unlinked nodes may remain reachable indefinitely from an
     * iterator, but unlike unlinked nodes, are never reachable from
     * head or tail.
     *
     * Making the data structure GC-robust will eliminate the risk of
     * unbounded memory retention with conservative GCs and is likely
     * to improve performance with generational GCs.
     *
     * When a node is dequeued at either end, e.g. via poll(), we would
     * like to break any references from the node to active nodes.  We
     * develop further the use of self-links that was very effective in
     * other concurrent collection classes.  The idea is to replace
     * prev and next pointers with special values that are interpreted
     * to mean off-the-list-at-one-end.  These are approximations, but
     * good enough to preserve the properties we want in our
     * traversals, e.g. we guarantee that a traversal will never visit
     * the same element twice, but we don't guarantee whether a
     * traversal that runs out of elements will be able to see more
     * elements later after enqueues at that end.  Doing gc-unlinking
     * safely is particularly tricky, since any node can be in use
     * indefinitely (for example by an iterator).  We must ensure that
     * the nodes pointed at by head/tail never get gc-unlinked, since
     * head/tail are needed to get "back on track" by other nodes that
     * are gc-unlinked.  gc-unlinking accounts for much of the
     * implementation complexity.
     *
     * Since neither unlinking nor gc-unlinking are necessary for
     * correctness, there are many implementation choices regarding
     * frequency (eagerness) of these operations.  Since volatile
     * reads are likely to be much cheaper than CASes, saving CASes by
     * unlinking multiple adjacent nodes at a time may be a win.
     * gc-unlinking can be performed rarely and still be effective,
     * since it is most important that long chains of deleted nodes
     * are occasionally broken.
     *
     * The actual representation we use is that p.next == p means to
     * goto the first node (which in turn is reached by following prev
     * pointers from head), and p.next == null && p.prev == p means
     * that the iteration is at an end and that p is a (static final)
     * dummy node, NEXT_TERMINATOR, and not the last active node.
     * Finishing the iteration when encountering such a TERMINATOR is
     * good enough for read-only traversals, so such traversals can use
     * p.next == null as the termination condition.  When we need to
     * find the last (active) node, for enqueueing a new node, we need
     * to check whether we have reached a TERMINATOR node; if so,
     * restart traversal from tail.
     *
     * The implementation is completely directionally symmetrical,
     * except that most public methods that iterate through the list
     * follow next pointers ("forward" direction).
     *
     * We believe (without full proof) that all single-element deque
     * operations (e.g., addFirst, peekLast, pollLast) are linearizable
     * (see Herlihy and Shavit's book).  However, some combinations of
     * operations are known not to be linearizable.  In particular,
     * when an addFirst(A) is racing with pollFirst() removing B, it is
     * possible for an observer iterating over the elements to observe
     * A B C and subsequently observe A C, even though no interior
     * removes are ever performed.  Nevertheless, iterators behave
     * reasonably, providing the "weakly consistent" guarantees.
     *
     * Empirically, microbenchmarks suggest that this class adds about
     * 40% overhead relative to ConcurrentLinkedQueue, which feels as
     * good as we can hope for.
